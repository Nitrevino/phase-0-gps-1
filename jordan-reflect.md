What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
merge conflicts make my skin crawl. I don't have a lot of experience with them and I just panic a little when the terminal complains. I know with time I will get more comfortable with them and I will also make it a point to do some independent research so I feel more confident tackling them.


What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The merge conflicts were clearly explained. Like when the merge message popped up in my sublime I had no idea I was supposed to closed it until I was directed to do so. 


What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I didn't really have any. I asked about merging on github.com vs terminal.


What still confuses you about Git?
I will never know everything about git but feel pretty comfortable with it for right now.


How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was great!
